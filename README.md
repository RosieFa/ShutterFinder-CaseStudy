# ShutterFinder-CaseStudy
Welcome to the repository for my ShutterFinder case study! ðŸ“¸ 
I'm excited to share my very first UX/UI design case study, 'Shutter Finder'! ðŸš€ðŸ“¸ As an entry-level product designer, I immersed myself in user research and iterative design to create a user-centric platform that connects individuals and businesses with reliable photographers near them. I'd love to hear your valuable feedback and insights! Let's connect and elevate the world of user experiences together! 
In this project, I designed a mobile application that connects individuals and businesses with reliable photographers in their vicinity. Through extensive user research and iterative design processes, I addressed diverse pain points, including geographical limitations, budget constraints, and trust issues, to create a user-centric platform. The repository contains the PDF case study outlining the project's objectives, design process, and the transformative impact on user experiences. I invite you to explore the case study and discover how ShutterFinder enhances accessibility and convenience in the world of photography services.
