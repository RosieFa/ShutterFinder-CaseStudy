# ShutterFinder-CaseStudy
Welcome to the repository for my ShutterFinder case study! ðŸ“¸ In this project, I designed a mobile application that connects individuals and businesses with reliable photographers in their vicinity. Through extensive user research and iterative design processes, I addressed diverse pain points, including geographical limitations, budget constraints, and trust issues, to create a user-centric platform. The repository contains the PDF case study outlining the project's objectives, design process, and the transformative impact on user experiences. I invite you to explore the case study and discover how ShutterFinder enhances accessibility and convenience in the world of photography services.
